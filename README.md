I created a College Management System using web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.The system has two parts: one for administrators and one for students. Administrators can update teacher and student information, manage schedules, and post notices. Students can log in to access their class schedules and receive college updates. This project made college tasks easier and improved communication.
